# Markdown Content Instructions (v1.x)

Scope: `_pages/**`, `_posts/**`, `_projects/**`, `_news/**`, `_teachings/**`, `_books/**`

## Guidance

- Keep starter content examples aligned with pluginized v1 behavior.
- Do not document runtime implementation details as starter-owned unless they truly are.
- When content depends on a plugin feature, ensure plugin wiring exists in `_config.yml` and `Gemfile`.

## Validation

Use the validated command set in `AGENTS.md`.
